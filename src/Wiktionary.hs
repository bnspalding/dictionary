--
-- Wiktionary provides tools for working with dictionary entries parsed from
-- Wiktionary <https://www.wiktionary.org>. It expects data files that have
-- already been parsed from the wiktionary xml format (clean, filter, and
-- process your data in advance), and it converts the set of entries into a
-- "Dictionary". This module expects JSON data generated from something like
-- <https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract>
--
-- A dictionary (in this package) maps a unique (text, pronunciation) pair with
-- a set of meanings. This is slightly different from the mappings between
-- representation and meaning used by Wiktionary, which means that the object
-- set that comprises the dictionary will be slightly different.
--
-- Pronunciations are interpreted using the General American English accent (See
-- "Dictionary" for more information. When there are multiple pronunciations for
-- a word, the General American accent pronunciation (if it exists) will be
-- preferred.

-- | WiktData represents a useful subset of the information that describes a word on
-- Wiktionary. An entry in Wiktionary is a single word (written form) and part
-- of speech together with a set of meanings (senses) and a set of
-- pronunciations.
--
-- Rather than make WiktData an instance of FromJSON, parsing happens in
-- "readJSONSingle". This is because of some weird parsing that has to happen
-- for pronunciations (which lack a consistent schema), and it just made sense
-- to do the rest of the parsing there as well (for consistency).
--
-- NOTE: many wiktionary entries lack pronunciations. It may be better to make
-- pronunciations optional

-- | WiktSense represents a meaning for a word. The fields here are a selective
-- subset of what comes with the original data. The gloss is the written meaning
-- or definition that describes the sense. Tags are a list of qualifiers and
-- categorical descriptors for the sense (such as \'colloqial\', \'present\', or
-- \'chemistry\').

-- | WiktPron represents a pronunciation for a word. While there are several
-- different representations used on Wiktionary for a pronunciation (IPA, enPR),
-- the parsed results here are limited to IPA representations. Each
-- pronunciation is associated with one or more accents (GenAm, Canadian,
-- Received Pronunciation).

-- Because an Entry takes a single text, pronunciation pair and a set of
-- definitions (gloss, pos), a single pronunciation is chosen (GenAm if it
-- exists) and the pos is mapped across all glosses.
