-- A Dictionary is a set of lexical entries. It associates a ('text', 'pronunciation')
-- pair with set of 'Definition's, where each association is an 'Entry'. A
-- Dictionary is ordered alphabetically by text.
--
-- A special note about this representation of a dictionary: The 'next' and
-- 'prev' functions wrap around (such that the last element points to the first,
-- and the first element points to the last when using 'next' and 'prev'). This
-- decision comes from the way that Dictionary is used in Sequence, Selection
-- libraries farther up the ladder.

-- | A Dictionary is a Map of Representations to Definitions. Use Entries when
-- working with a dictionary, not Reps.
--
-- A map is used to make sense of merging definitions to a representation. All
-- dictionary methods wrap inputs and outputs in Entries, so there should never
-- be a need to work with the internal Rep, {Definition} map representation.
type Dictionary = Map.Map Rep (Set.Set Definition)

-- | Rep (short for Repesentation) is a (text, pronunciation) pair. Together
-- with a set of definitions, it forms a dictionary entry. Most of the time, you
-- should be working with Entries, rather than Reps.
--
-- For example,
-- ("read", "ɹid") is a unique pair separate from ("read", "ɹɛd"), ("reed",
-- "ɹid"), and ("red", "ɹɛd").
data Rep
  = Rep
      { _text :: T.Text,
        _pron :: Pronunciation
      }
  deriving (Eq, Show)

-- | Rep is sorted by its text component (alphabetically, like a dictionary)
instance Ord Rep where
  compare r1 r2 = compare (_text r1) (_text r2)

-- | A Definition is a meaning, an ontological unit of a dictionary.
data Definition
  = Definition
      { -- | gloss gives the textual definition for a word
        gloss :: T.Text,
        -- | pos gives the part of speech tied to the definition
        pos :: T.Text
      }
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

-- | an Entry associates a (text, pronunciation) pair with a set of unique
-- definitions. The structure of an Entry is how we should think about the data,
-- even though the underlying representation in the map is slightly different.
-- All Dictionary methods return Entries, not (rep, def) pairs.
--
-- Entries are compared based on their text, and they are evaluated for equality
-- (uniqueness) based on their (text, pronunciation) pair.
data Entry
  = Entry
      { text :: T.Text,
        definitions :: Set.Set Definition, -- gloss, pos
        pronunciation :: Pronunciation -- same as Sound.Word, i.e. [Syl]
      }
  deriving (Show)

-- | Entries are ordered based on their text (alphabetically)
instance Ord Entry where
  compare e1 e2 = compare (text e1) (text e2)

-- | Entries are unique based on their (text, pronunciation) pair
instance Eq Entry where
  e1 == e2 = text e1 == text e2 && pronunciation e1 == pronunciation e2

-- | fromList generates a Dictionary from a list of Entries. Definitions are
-- merged under unique (text, pronunciation) pairs.
fromList :: [Entry] -> Dictionary
fromList es = Map.fromListWith Set.union (_toInternal <$> es)

-- | fromStringTuples constructs a dictionary from a list of string tuples
-- that are generated, for example, from parsing a file
fromStringTuples :: [(T.Text, T.Text, T.Text, T.Text)] -> Dictionary
fromStringTuples ts = fromList $ uncurriedMakeEntry <$> ts
  where
    uncurriedMakeEntry (t, d, p, pr) = makeEntry1 t d p pr

-- | first provides the first element of the Dictionary (by text, ascending)
first :: Dictionary -> Entry
first = _entry . Map.elemAt 0

-- | last provides the last element of the Dictionary (by text, ascending)
last :: Dictionary -> Entry
last d = _entry $ Map.elemAt (size d - 1) d

-- | the size of the dictionary. See "Data.Map".'Map.size'
size :: Dictionary -> Int
size = Map.size

-- | next gives the next element of the Dictionary (alphabetically).
-- Next wraps around the dictionary when given the last entry (it gives the
-- first)
next :: Dictionary -> Entry -> Entry
next d entry = _entry $ Map.elemAt i d
  where
    prevI = Map.findIndex (_toRep entry) d
    i =
      if prevI == size d - 1
        then 0
        else prevI + 1

-- | prev gives the previous element of the Dictionary (alphabetically).
-- Prev wraps around the dictionary when given the first entry (it gives the
-- last)
prev :: Dictionary -> Entry -> Entry
prev d entry = _entry $ Map.elemAt i d
  where
    nextI = Map.findIndex (_toRep entry) d
    i =
      if nextI == 0
        then size d - 1
        else nextI - 1

-- | contains reports whether the Dictionary contains a (text, pronunciation)
-- entry. Note that because equality for Entries is based only on (text,
-- pronunciation), you can construct a mock entry containing just these
-- elements.
contains :: Dictionary -> Entry -> Bool
contains d e = Map.member (_toRep e) d

-- TODO: add containsText and containsPron

-- becase lookupGE returns the first entry GE an entry with text "c"
-- it is necessary to ensure the entry actually starts with c
-- otherwise, firstOfLetter d 's' could return entry with text "t..."
-- for a dictionary with no entries beginning with 's'

-- | firstOfLetter provides the first entry whose text begins with a given
-- letter. If there are no entries in the Dictionary that begin with the given
-- letter, Nothing is returned.
firstOfLetter :: Dictionary -> Char -> Maybe Entry
firstOfLetter d c =
  let mockE = Rep {_text = T.singleton c, _pron = []}
      maybeE = _entry <$> Map.lookupGE mockE d
   in case maybeE of
        Nothing -> Nothing
        Just e ->
          if T.head (text e) == c
            then Just e
            else Nothing

-- | makeEntry constructs an Entry out of its constituent components. makeEntry
-- takes a list of definitions as its second argument. Use makeEntry1 to
-- construct entries from single-definition, flat argument sets.
makeEntry :: T.Text -> [(T.Text, T.Text)] -> T.Text -> Entry
makeEntry _text _defs _pronString =
  Entry _text defs (makePronunciation _pronString)
  where
    defs = Set.fromList $ uncurry Definition <$> _defs

-- | makeEntry1 constructs an Entry with a single definition from its
-- constituent elements. makeEntry1 can be used to generate Entries more simply.
-- It generates the pronunciation for the entry from an IPA symbol string using
-- "Sound.Pronunciation".'Sound.Pronunciation.makePronunciation'.
makeEntry1 :: T.Text -> T.Text -> T.Text -> T.Text -> Entry
makeEntry1 _text _gloss _pos _pronString =
